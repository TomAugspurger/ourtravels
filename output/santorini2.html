<p>After the guided tour <a href="http://ourtravels.herokuapp.com/santorini1.html">yesterday</a>, we were ready to do some exploring on our own.
Well, not quite on our own.
We paired up with Chris and Laruen, our friends we made at the bed and breakfast, to rent a car to take down to the beaches.
Our goal was to find three beaches: Red Beach, Black Beach, and White Beach.</p>
<p>After a slight detour thanks to Tom's navigation skills (he blames the map),
we arrived at our first beach of the day: Red Beach.</p>

<p>Turning the corner to see this huge wall open up in front of you was a great experience.</p>

<p>The water was a bit chilly at first, but pleasant after a bit.
Apparently the 85Â°F we've enjoyed the past couple days is still cool for Santorini.
But the dry heat is a nice break from the humidity of Iowa.
One beach down, still two to go.</p>
<p>Just up the road from the Red Beach was an archaeological site of a settlment dating back to 2000 BC.
The entire site is covered by a large roof to preserve everything (and also to give some nice shade).</p>

<p>The trek continued with a search for Black Beach.
We missed a turn, and ended up at the old lighthouse on the Southwest tip of the island.
This offered some more great views of the area.</p>

<p>We stopped to ask for some directions to the Black Beach, and were told that it's only accessible by boat.
Somewhat disappointed, we followed a sign pointing to another beach.
The drive down was on a narrow, steep gravel road, but Chris was confident we could manage it.
A the bottom of the road, lo and behold, the Black Beach!
At least we think it was the Black Beach; two down, and one more to go.</p>

<p>We swam for a while longer and found some caves (but didn't swim inside).
Chris and Lauren swam around the corner of the cover and found the White Beach,
so we'll say three for three.</p>
<p>Still having a bit of time, we drove over to the town of Perissa, on the east coast of Santorini.
We found one more beach before heading home to grab some traditional Greek for dinner.</p>

<p>Santorini was great, and it will be sad to leave.
We were also lucky to meet some great people in Chris and Lauren.</p>
<p>Next up: Athens!</p>
