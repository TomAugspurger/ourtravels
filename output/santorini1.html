<p>After flying into Athens, we spent a short night in the port town of Piraeus. From there, we took the 7:30 AM ferry to the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini">Santorini</a>.</p>

<p>We are staying at the Pension George, a small bed and breakfast located in the village of Karterados.</p>

<p>Our host, Helen, is as sweet as can be.
She moved to Greece from England 27 years ago.</p>
<p>Our first day on Santorini was quiet.
Mostly, we were adjusting to the time zone change.  We enjoyed some time at the pool and went grocery shopping.</p>

<p>Day two was much more eventful.
We rode a bus down to the port.
The ride was a bit scary, as our bus barely managed the tight hairpin turns!
We jumped on <em>The Odyssey</em>, a tour bout, and set out.</p>

<p>The first stop was the volcano island, Nea Kameni.
From there, we got some great views of the main island and learned a bit about the history of the island and its past of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Our guide, George, dug a small hole in the soil, so we could feel the heat rising from below.
A short boat ride later was a hot spring.
We jumped off the side of the boat into the Mediterranean Sea and swam to the hot spring.</p>

<p>Tom's white swim trunks changed color to a reddish brown from the iron and sulfur-infused water.</p>
<p>Next was Therasia, a small island across the caldera from the main island.
This offered a steep walk up 504 stairs.</p>

<p>Each step required a few walking steps in-between. The walk was quite tiring, but provided a great view and a much needed beer at the top.</p>

<p>Finally, we took the boat to Oia, a picturesque town on the North of the island.
Oia is famous for its sunsets, so we hung around with some friends we met at our hotel.</p>
