Title: Rome Day 2
Date: 2014-06-20

I have to be honest, when the alarm went off this morning I was not ready to get up!  We caught the 6:30 train into Rome and we were at the Vatican by 7:30.  We started in St. Peter's Square and Basilica.

We then took the 550+ stairs to the top of the dome!  The walk up was claustrophobic at times, but worth it in the end.

Next, we were off to the the museum.  Because we do not have wi-fi in our hotel, we were unable to reserve tickets ahead of time.  This caused us to have to wait in line for about 2 hours!
Luckily the line was in the shade and there were plenty of sandwich shops along the way.
We met a nice gentleman from South Korea living in Germany (for school) and visiting Rome while in line.
It's been great connecting with people from around the world sharing similar experiences.

By the time we made it out of the museum our bodies were aching and we were hungry.
We had lunch at BIS, which would fit right in in Des Moines' East Village.
Tom enjoyed a curry chicken sandwich, while I had Penne with red sauce.

Once back at the hotel we tried to find the pool one last time.  No luck!

So, it is time to enjoy our cheese and bread and head to bed.  Tomorrow is another early day with a day trip to Pompeii.
