What an amazing weekend! On Friday night we took a night train. This was not a pleasant ride. We ran into two other camp counselors, and got on the train together. We went to where we were supposed to sit, and found our cabin was full. A woman explained to us that they had to switch trains and the seats don't match the reservations. So, we had to find a seat in what seemed to be a full train. We found a conductor, and he went around knocking on rooms until he found us seats. There were two guys in the cabin where he had a sit. They were in their boxers and it smelled really bad! After 12 hours of travel we we made it to Amsterdam.

We decided to go the tourist route this time and buy the 24 hr. iAmsterdam pass. It got us access to all the museums, public transportation, and some gifts at various businesses. We started out at the Van Gogh museum. Van Gogh's art was great, but there was less of it than I expected. The modern art exhibition was interesting, but isn't exactly my cup of tea.

After Van Gogh, we went to the NEMO science center. This was a blast. Everything was hands on and interactive, so it was great to be able to play around with their exhibits. The most interesting part of the center would probably be the exhibit on sex they had set up for 12-18 year olds. There is no way something like that would be set up for 12 year olds in the states.

Following the science center we made our way outside of the city center to our hostel to find out there was a mix up with our reservation. We ended up paying to stay in Hotel Ibis right by the train station, but it was a stressful few hours.

Our iAmsterdam card also came with a free canal cruise. I had no idea how maritime of a city Amsterdam was before we went. There are a series of canals, around and throughout the city. The tour was great, and a nice way to see the city.

Since we were in Amsterdam, we had to see the red light district. We only spent about 15 minutes walking through, and that was plenty. It was a great cultural experience, and I glad we went.
