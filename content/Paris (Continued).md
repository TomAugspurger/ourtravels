Another weekend in the city of romance. Speeding along the French countryside at 318 km/hr makes the 2.5 hour trip an easy one. We left Kaiserslautern at 7:22 Saturday morning, and made it to Paris before 10.

Being old pros at public transit in Paris, we headed downstairs in the train station and took the metro to our hotel where we dropped off our bags. Then we got on the train going out to Versailles to spend the afternoon touring the palace.

The palace is amazing, especially the famed hall of mirrors, but my favorite part of the grounds was Marie Antoinette little “village” of cottages. There are pictures of these in my album.

After leaving Versailles we made our way back to the Eiffel Tower (we actually waited in the hour and a half line to go up this time).

The next day Allison and I got up and went to mass at Notre Dame. We went to the Gregorian Chant mass, and it was a great experience. Afterwards we took the metro over to the Champs De Elysees to see what was going on for the tour. The riders didn't come through until 4:45 but by noon, things were already crazy. There were vendors everywhere and the streets and metro were packed. Our train left at 5:09 so we took the subway back over to Notre Dame because the riders went by there before going over to the Champs. Around 3:15 the caravan came through, which was basically just a bunch of companies advertising on cars and some floats. Unfortunately, at 4:20 the riders still hadn't come through, so we decided to bag it and get on the metro back to the station to catch our train. I guess the riders came by around 4:35. It would have been exciting to see, but it was still a great afternoon. So it goes.

This weekend we have Vienna (opening weekend of Don Giovanni... opera anyone?) and next weekend is Amsterdam, followed by Prague. Oh and then we have the long trip to Cedar Falls, IA after that. Almost forgot that one.
