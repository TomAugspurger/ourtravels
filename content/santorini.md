After flying into Athens, we spent a short night in the port town of Piraeus. From there, we took the 7:30 AM ferry to the island of [Santorini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini).

We are staying at the Pension George, a small bed and breakfast located in the village of Karterados.

Our host, Helen, is as sweet as can be.
She moved to Greece from England 27 years ago.

Our first day on Santorini was quiet.
Mostly, we were adjusting to the time zone change.  We enjoyed some time at the pool and went grocery shopping.

Day two was much more eventful.
We rode a bus down to the port.
The ride was a bit scary, as our bus barely managed the tight hairpin turns!
We jumped on *The Odyssey*, a tour bout, and set out.

The first stop was the volcano island, Nea Kameni.
From there, we got some great views of the main island and learned a bit about the history of the island and its past of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Our guide, George, dug a small hole in the soil, so we could feel the heat rising from below.
A short boat ride later was a hot spring.
We jumped off the side of the boat into the Mediterranean Sea and swam to the hot spring.

Tom's white swim trunks changed color to a reddish brown from the iron and sulfur-infused water.

Next was Therasia, a small island across the caldera from the main island.
This offered a steep walk up 504 stairs.

Each step required a few walking steps in-between. The walk was quite tiring, but provided a great view and a much needed beer at the top.

Finally, we took the boat to Oia, a picturesque town on the North of the island.
Oia is famous for its sunsets, so we hung around with some friends we met at our hotel.
