We arrived in Dublin last night, after the flight from Brussels.
For our first day in Ireland, we took the train over to Cork.

About a half-hour by bus ride from Cork had us in Blarney, home to Blarney castle and the famous Blarney Stone.
The castle was pretty a standard medieval one, and reminded us of the ones in Wales.

The most interesting part was probably the dungeons at the base of the castle.
They were very dark, narrow, and low passages that eventually led to a dead end.

It shouldn't have surprised us that it would be a dead end, since they were dungeons after all.

After climbing up the tower to look at the Blarney Stone (neither of us kissed it), we strolled through the gardens for a while.

We had a bit of time before our train back to Dublin, so we made the short trip to Cobh.
This was the last port the *Titanic* called at before it sank.

Then it was back home to Dublin.
We're staying near the Temple Bar area, which is packed with good places to eat.
