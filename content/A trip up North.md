This weekend was a different kind of weekend in many ways. We were planning on going to Venice up until Thursday, but because of some issues with getting reservations, we ended up switching to Belgium. We didn't really have an itinerary, just a place to see, and a reservation for our hostel (which ended up being a hotel). With just the four of us (Kayla, Jason, Allison and I), it was a smaller group than our previous trips. We didn't do any tours or museums. For the most part, we ended up walking around Brussels experiencing the culture. We had great chocolate and waffles.

Another big difference was the trains. The saying "you don't appreciate what you have until it's taken away" holds true here. German trains are almost always on time, but Belgium gave us a bit of a different experience. On the way there, we were supposed to ride a train from Aachen to Liege, and change over there for the train to Brussels. The train to Liege was late to begin with, and then we stopped on the tracks a few minutes into the ride. The ticket checker came by, asked us where we were going, and told us to get off on the next station and go to platform 5. We trusted him, and somehow made it to Brussels, only a half hour behind our scheduled arrival time.

On the way back we had another interesting train experience. We got up early Sunday to get to Cologne early.  It was supposed to be a straight short from Brussels to Cologne, but there was some electrical problems on the tracks (still in Belgium), so we stopped on the tracks for about a half hour before they turned us around and we went back to our last station. From there they put us on a bus to Aachen, where we grabbed a train to Cologne, just 3 hours behind schedule. We had a few hours to spend in Cologne, and we really lucked out to catch mass five minutes after we arrived. We made it to Kaiserslautern, just a short ride away from Ramstein, and thought our ordeals were over for the day. But, on our last train, we got on the wrong end of a train split, so we ended up getting in an hour later than scheduled. But in the end we made it, and had another great weekend under our belt.
