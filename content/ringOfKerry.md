title: Ring of Kerry
date: 2014-08-11

Today we completed our attempted trip from [Saturday](dublin.html).
Our train made it to Killarney on time and we jumped straight on the bus that promptly set off for the Ring of Kerry.
Our bus driver, Jim O'Neil, has been doing this for 30 years and is apparently somewhat famous.

We travelled along the ring counter-clockwise, so our first stop was along the Atlantic Ocean at the southwest tip of Ireland.
They had a couple of optional touristy things you could pay extra for, a bog tour and a sheepdog show, but we opted for enjoying the scenery.

We worked our way along the coast, stopping at a "cliff-side" restaurant for lunch (we brought our own) and some nice pictures.
The views were great, but we never had a chance to go down to the water.

After that we were down into the valley between the mountains.
John was fond of pointing out houses and how much they sold for (€450,000 was the max), and how many had been built during the boom of the early 2000s and hadn't sold since the bust.

There was one more stop at a shop and café where we watched one of the workers weave a blanket on a loom, and got some good views of a part of the Ring.

The last bit of the tour was through Killarney National Park.
The park was huge and beautiful.

Then it was back on the train for the ride home to Dublin.
These bus tours are great for seeing the places you need to see.
It's making us want to come back to Ireland, rent a car, and stay a bed and breakfasts in the country side as we take our time to see the beautiful sights in more detail.
