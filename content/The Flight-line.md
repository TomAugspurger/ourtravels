Today for flight line, we took a trip over to the flight-line. One of the staff at the center has a friend who works on the planes and he gave us a bit of a tour. The flight-line is basically a huge, huge concrete slab. There are a few hangers, but for the most part the planes sit outside unless they are going to be worked on for a while. We were lucky enough to start our tour on a C-17. The plane is almost entirely storage. The cargo hold floor (which is probably 95% of the plane) is entirely metal planks with latches for hooks, and can be flipped over to use as rollers. We all squeezed into the flight deck and got a tour of the cockpit. The kids loved sitting in the pilot's and copilot's chair. Next, they opened up the back cargo door. The whole plane shook when the bottom door hit the ground to form the ramp up into the storage.

Right outside the opened cargo door was a Boeing 747. It is one of the 4 planes which go everywhere the President goes on Air Force One (President Obama is in Italy right now for the G8 summit). Unfortunately we weren't able to go near it because it was under the highest security level.

Next we took the walk over to a C-5. The C-5 is another cargo plane, and is just massive. It has 4 engines and 28 tires. Unfortunately the German sky opened up on us and it started raining on our walk over. We reached the plane just before as it started to downpour. The “steps” into the plane is basically a ladder, and become extremely slick when wet so we couldn't take the kids into it. However, it is pretty awesome to say that I took cover from a German rainstorm under the tail of a C-5.

Overall it was a massively cool field trip. Unfortunately we couldn't take pictures because the military frowns on that sort of thing on there facilities. We'll take plenty in Paris this weekend though.
