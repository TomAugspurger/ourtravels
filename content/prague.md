Bill and Billy are preparing for their finals, so us and Brian took
a bus from Nurmeberg to Prague.
Allison and I had been there for a day 5 years ago, but we enjoyed
it so much we were happy to go again.

For our first day we did the wakling tour.
This took us around the New Town and Old Town.
Our tour guide was certainly our most interesting yet.

These tours are 3 hours long, and they have a break in the middle
of the tour to get a drink or food and use the bathroom.
They also have a person there selling tickets to their other tours.
We were actually left behind by our group while we were buying
tickets, so we missed the last half.
That was OK with us though, and we just made our way up to the castle
on our own.

We all got tickets for the beer tour that night, where we got to
sample a few different Czech beers and meet some other travellers.
After the tour we got a really good dinner with a couple we met on the tour.

Allison and Brian also got tickets to go to Terezin, a former
concentration camp (Tom was applying for jobs).
