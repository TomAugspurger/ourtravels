title: Paris (Day 3)
date: 2014-07-18

After failing to go to the catacombs last time because the line was too long, we made sure to show up early.
The catacombs open a 10:00. So we got there at 8:15 and a line had already started.

Once we got our tickets, we took a long spiral staircase done into the catacombs.
They are an old, abandoned limestone quarry from before the 1800s.
In the 1800s they were converted to a burial site for a lot of the dead in paris.
They estimate that the skeletons of about 6 million people are down there.
Seeing all the bones and skulls stacked up was a bit creepy, but interesting.

Before our Fat Tire Bike Tour at 3:00, we had a little picnic at the Eiffel Tower.

Then we went down the road to the Fat Tire offices.
Our tour guide, Kat, was from Florida and had worked at all the parks there.
She took us around the city, stopping at the Military Acadamy, the War Hospital, the Lourve, Notre Dame, and others.

We finished up the afternoon tour at about 7:00, and turned right around to get on the *night* tour, this one lead by Amanda.
This was actually our second time doing the night ride; we did it when we were in Paris last time.

Allison was selected as the "Ass Man", who stays in the back and make sure that everyone keeps in front of her.
She did great, but those busses got a little close.

The night ride goes to an ice cream vendor near Notre Dame;
We enjoyed it so much last time that we got 4 flavors:

- strawberry
- apricot
- manderin
- melon

The night ride ends with a ride on a river boat through the Siene river (and a bit of wine).
It's a great tour and we'd definately recommend it.
