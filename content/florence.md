Title: Florence
Date: 2014-06-24

Today we visited the Renaissance city of Florence (or Firenze).
We're definitely getting into the high season for tourism;
the city was packed.
Today may have been especially busy because it was the feast day of San Giovanni, the patron saint of Florence.

We had a walking tour scheduled at 11:00, but arrived before that.
As we strolled through a plaza we heard drums and horns, and saw a parade coming through.

We think it was the Historic Parade, part of the San Giovanni festival.

The theme of the tour was "Renaissance", so we made our way down to the famous Duomo.

It's tough to describe just how large the cathedral and its dome is.
The place is just massive.

We ended up leaving to tour early.
While interesting, it got a bit repetitive and neither of us are the biggest architecture buffs.
That said the architecture we did see was cool.

We knew we had to see Michelangelo's *David*, but Tom forgot the map and we couldn't remember which museum it was in (FYI it's at the Accademia Gallery).
We did know there was a bronze cast of it at Michelangelo's Plazza, about a 20 minute walk away, including a steep hill at the end.

Sadly, at the top of the hill we found the area blocked off for the festival

On the way back to the train station we slipped into the Duomo.
