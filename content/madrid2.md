title: Madrid (Day 2)
date: 2014-07-12

For our last day in Madrid we wanted a bit of a break from the go-go-go of traveling.
We've been over here for just about a month, and we have a month left, so a "normal" day was in order.

The day started and ended with chocolate and churros, which we've agreed is the correct way to do things.

We walked over to the parks near the Prado museum, after wandering a bit along the way.

For lunch we went to *Taberna el Bu*, where Allison got a super-fresh, cold tomato soup.

Tom got guacamole and wheat pancakes (the pancakes were actually just tortillas).
The tapas they brought were the olives.
We've tried 4 or 5 olive dishes since coming over, and this was the first that we've really enjoyed.

After lunch was a movie (*The Fault in our Stars*).
We made sure it was in English (*V.O.* or *version originale*).

We weren't planning on getting more chocolate and churros from *San Gines*, but some of our roommates came back and had just eaten some.
We actually got a *cafe con late* for dipping the churros this time instead of chocolate.

Coffee probably wasn't the best choice at 10:00 at night when you've got a 5:50 train the next morning, but it sure was tasty.

The next couple days we're making our way to Paris.
We'll stop over in Rennes to check out Mt. St. Michele.
