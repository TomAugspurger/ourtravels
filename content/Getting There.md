On the car ride to the airport I assured Tom that I had my passport, but I did not have my headphones.  He told me not to worry, because we could share his.  My problem was solved, until, he realized that his were at home too!  I was able to find some for pretty cheap in the Detroit airport.

Speaking of the airport, it was pretty cool.  There were color changing hallways, huge fountains, and a tram.  Our four hour layover went very fast.  We at pizza at Hungry Howie's, went shopping, and played cards.  On the plane I watched The Reader and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  Tom watched Taken and slept.

After almost 24 hours of traveling we finally made it to the base. Its a little over an hour's drive from Frankfurt. The German countryside is beautiful, and it was an enjoyable ride. It took a while to get our base ID's, but now we're set. The base is huge. We haven't really gotten a chance to explore, but the scale is just off the charts.
