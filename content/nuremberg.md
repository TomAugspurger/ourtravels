title: Nürnberg
date: 2014-08-01

We continued our travels through Bavaria in Nürnberg.
Bill and Billy are here taking a course for law school, and it was great
to see some familiar faces.
We had about about a week before Brian got into town, which we filled up
by taking day trips around southern Germany and Austria.

For our first day we went to Kassél, Germany, where we visited the Lion's castle.

They only let you see the inside on a guided tour, and it was just us and a
German Father and son.
The tour was in German, but the tour guide was very nice and told us to ask questions.

While the castle was nice, I think our favorite part was the gardens.
The castle and another castle / Museum is located in a large park about a
half-hour walk from the train station.
The gardens had a lot of water features.

The next day we went to Rothenburg.
This is a medieval walled town that reminded us of [Lucca](lucca.md).

They have a famous snack that translates to "Snowball", and is pretty much just
fried dough covered in chocolate or sugar.

Since it was a short trip, we had time to get back and check out Nürnberg
a bit.
We took the 20 minute walk across the old town to the castle.
The best parts were probably the well, where the guide demonstrated
the depth by pouring water down and showing how long it took for the
sound to echo back up.
After that was the climb up the largest tower.
This gave a 360 degree view over Nürnberg.

Under each window was a pair of pictures with that exact view of Nürnberg
before and just after WWII, when it was bombed.

The day after that was a trip down to Austria.
We couldn't decide whether we should go to Innsbruck or Salzburg.
In the end, rain in Salzburg and Allison's desire to see the Alps again gave
the edge to Innsbruck.

We took the day pretty easy, just walking around and enjoying the views.

For our last day in Nürnberg, Bill took us and Brian over to the
[Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds).
It was crazy to see how large the grounds were, and to remember the images of the
rallies.
They weren't kept in the best shape thought; apparently there's some contention
among the various levels of government about who should foot the bill, and
not too much willingness to preserve the grounds in the first place.
