We haven't had too many posts on camp so I figured I should put one up. At my place we have two half day camps. This week I have flight camp in the morning and Nick camp in the afternoon. The kids have been great this week and both camps are going really well. Today for flight camp we had two pilots come in, and tomorrow we get to go down to the flight line and tour a C-17 or C-130. Should be fun!

P.S. Going to Paris this weekend! We're touring the city on Saturday and the Louvre on Sunday. Its only 2.5 hours from Kaiserslautern so we'll have two full days!
