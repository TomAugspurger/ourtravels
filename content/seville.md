Today we took the train down south to the Andulician capital, Seville.
After a bit of a hassle at the station, we were able to make a reservation (every country needs to license their ticketing software from Germany or Switzerland).

The old city center is about a 25 minute walk from the train station.
We picked up lunch at a touristy place on the main road.
It wasn't very good in comparison to Taste yesterday, but we got a chance to try a seafood paella.
We ate the shrimp and oysters, but didn't try a couple other things whose identity we couldn't quite place.

The two big sights to see are the Seville Cathedral and the palace: Real Alcázar.

For the most part this cathedral felt like a lot of the others we'd been too, and didn't seem worth the €16.00 we paid to get in.
This one did have a few neat items though.
They had the tomb of Christopher Columbus and a fancy reliquary.
Also, since the place was originally a mosque, there were some other rooms you wouldn't typically find in a catholic church.
Finally, the bell tower was a converted minaret.

We made our way down the street to Real Alcázar.
This palace started out its history under the Moors, before being taken over by the Christian, Spanish kings.
The walls, floors, and ceilings all had a variety of tiles and mosaics.
They also had the best gardens we've seen so far.

Since it was so hot out (34°C) we made the long, slow walk back to the train station early.
