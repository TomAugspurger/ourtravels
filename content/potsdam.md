We spent the day in and around the town of Potsdam, about a 20 minute train ride west of Berlin.

Around the town are a bunch of palaces and other buildings used by German royalty.

We got the day pass, but there's no way you could see everything in one day.
We made it to:

- The Old Palace
- The New Chambers
- The Church of Peace
- The Old Windmill
- The Oranjarie

and maybe one more... it's hard to remember since they all ran together.
All the buildings were scattered across a huge park.

We don't have photos from inside the buildings, since that cost extra.
They had a lot of interesting rooms though, mostly in the [*rococo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) style that King Frederich the Great prefered.

It was a fun day, but very tiring.
We took the train back to our hotel, got some great doner, and called it a night.
