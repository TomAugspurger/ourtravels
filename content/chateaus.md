title: Châteaus
date: 2014-07-16

Today we visited two of the Châteaus close to Paris

- Chenonceaux
- Amboise

Chenonceaux
===========

We trained south to the small village of Chenonceaux.
When the ticket checker saw that we were American, he asked if we were going to Chenonceaux.
When we replied that we were, he smiled and said "Of course, of course."

The château was a fun place.
It's situated on and in a river, the *Cher*.

During World War I, the château was used as a hospital.

Our favorite part inside the château was probably the kitchen.
It was located downstairs in the large pillars that support the rest of the château above the river.

Even better than the inside of the château were the gardens outside.
There were 4 gardens spread across the grounds, including one large vegetable and flower garden.
The rooms inside the château featured nice flower arrangements, which we think came from the flower garden.

Amboise
=======

The second château of the day, this one in Amboise, was about 30 minutes away by train.

It may be hard to believe, but we actually went to the *wrong castle.*
As we walked across the river we saw a castle and went in.
It turns out we went into the Royal Château of Amboise, when we had planned on going to Château du Clos Lucé.

We still had fun at the one we went to.
It was one of the homes used by the King back in the day, and was where Leonardo da Vinci lived out his later days.

Afterwards we got some gelato, took the train back to Paris, got some *more* gelato, and went home for the night.
