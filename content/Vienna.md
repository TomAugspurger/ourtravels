Last weekend Allison and I took the trains to Vienna. It was a beautiful city, and we both had a great time. For being such a populous city, Vienna’s size is incredibly small. Most of the major tourist attractions are located in the heart of the city, all within a few miles of each other. The highlights of the day were probably the tour of Mozart’s house the Music Museum. We also saw St. Steven’s Cathedral, the Parliament and Rathous, and a couple of palaces to round out the day.

That night we went to see an orchestra play some selections of Mozart and Strauss. It was a great evening of music.

After the concert we caught the night train to Freiburg, Germany, and wandered around there for a few hours before heading home. The tourist office was closed when we got there so we just visited a few churches and explored the city.

Up next is Amsterdam this weekend, followed by Prague the weekend after.
