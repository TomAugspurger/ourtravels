Title: In Transit
Date: 2014-06-18

Sorry for the radio silence.
The last few days have been full of travel from Greece to Italy (with no wi-fi).
We took a bus ride up through the mountains to Delphi, and from there along beautiful coast to the port town of Patras.

The ride to Patras took *much* longer than expected, so we missed the ferry to Bari, Italy.
It ended up for the best though, since we found a cafe with wi-fi, booked a surprisingly nice room, and spent some time in Patras, which turned out to be a pleasant place.

The next day we went down to the port early to ensure that we made the ferry.
After 17 hours on the ferry, we decided that while it was a good experience, next time we'd just fly.

We arrived in Bari and took a taxi to the train station.
A 5 hour train ride later, and we were in Rome.
Our hotel is actually in a suburb of Rome, Frascatti.
It's the Hotel Gratzioli, and apprently is on old villa from the Reinassance times.
The second floor of the lobby even has an art gallery.
