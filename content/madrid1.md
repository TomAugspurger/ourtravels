Title: Madrid (Day 1)
Date: 2014-07-09

Today was our first full day in Madrid, the capital of Spain.
We started off the day with a visit to the Royal Palace.
The royal family, which neither of us knew Spain still had, doesn't live there anymore.

The palace seemed fairly typical as far as palaces go.
The defining characteristic of this one is probably the amount of wealth displayed (they had a room with 6 Stradivarius violins and violas).
We also saw a peacock just hanging around.

After the palace we swung by an Egyptian temple.
Apparently Egypt gave it to Spain of Spain helped them out with something.

Next, walked back towards the city center to each lunch at a place we'd scouted out the night before.

We ordered Sangrias, croquettes, potatoes, and bread with olive oil.
When our Sangrias were brought out, the waiter also brought a really great chorizo dish.
This is the real version of tapas, a free dish with your drinks.

When we ordered the croquettes we expected them to be filled with cheese and ham or chorizo.
Instead they were fish croquettes, and neither of us are the biggest seafood fans.
But we somehow managed.

As we were about to leave, the owner came over and gave us shots of a sweet liqueur from Northern Spain for our siesta.

After a refreshing lunch, we walked the block over to Plaza Mayor to catch the free walking tour.
Our guide, Eric, was really good.
Since Allison hadn't drank anything in a while, a Sangria and a shot was enough to make her legs a bit tingly for the walk.

The tour focused on the western half of Madrid.
That's the older section with history going back to the Moors, Spanish, and Austrian rulers. 
There was a lot of talk about fascism, anarchism and the Spanish Civil War.

Following the tour, we went into the Cathedral just across from the Royal Palace.

A long walk back to the hostel prompted a stop for bubble tea. We went tropical. It was quite  refreshing, with a coconut liquid and tropical jellies.

To cap off the full day, we stopped at San Gines for churros and chocolate.
Apparently it's a pretty famous place.
It was packed and there were a bunch of pictures of people, presumably famous, hanging on the wall.
