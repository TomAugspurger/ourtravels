On Sunday morning we work from our beautiful slumber, in the tents, bright and early.  We went to breakfast at the main hostel, and enjoyed some great granola, fruit, and bread.  I could feel my stomach begin to stir with the reality of what we were planning to do finally sinking in.  To be quite honest I would have been perfectly fine with them telling us we were unable to go canyoning, but they didn't.

At about 9:00 am we began to get together our wetsuits, water shoes, life jackets, and helmets.  I was getting nervous!  After packing our gear the 19 of us got into two vans, and drove into the mountains....We stopped on the side of the road about 45 minutes later, and changed into our suits on the side of the road.  Then we got back in the vans, and we drove to the canyon.  I went to the side of the road and looked down, holding onto a metal railing (which I am assuming stops cars from driving off the cliff).  It was a 170ft drop, and that's exactly where we were expected to repel.  I was not exactly excited!  I watched the group before us repel so confidently, and each of them jumped nice and high so the photographer could take a cool picture.  It was finally my turn, and I got down to where I was supposed to pose for my picture, but I could not let go of the rope, let alone jump!  So I'm sure my picture is pretty boring.  Then I get to the area where our guide can not see me anymore, I loose my footing and begin to slide on my butt.  Before I know it I am facing the opposite rock wall.  It was beautiful, but definatly not what I wanted to be looking at.  I regained my footing and made it into the water of the canyon.  The water was cold.  Luckily the wetsuits kept everything but our hands and face warm.  Walking through the rock filled water was amazing, and the view of the Swiss Alps left us speechless.

As we hiked through the canyon water, there were a series of jumps and slides. Before each, the guide would give us a quick description of the jump or slide and then demonstrate for us. Now these demonstrations left no guarantee that we would do it correctly.  When they would point and say don't jump there, I thought to myself telling me that will probably cause me to do just that.  We had some close calls, but everyone made it back in one piece.  To be honest I can't put  this experience into words.

Watch the video on the previous blog, and our pictures should be coming in the mail!

We ended the trip with a swiss beer, cheese, and bread.
