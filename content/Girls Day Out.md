Our day began with a 6:00 AM train.  About four hours later we arrived in Luxembourg.  We walked to many different places, stopping to shop along the way.  The bridges were very impressive, and made this destination of the most beautiful I have seen.  We stumbled upon the casemates.  These were the first underground tunnels built in the 1600â€™s.  For two euro we got to explore these tunnels.  They were are one of my favorite sites, thus far.  They also kept us cool on a hot day.



After a full morning of site seeing we ate a cafe called Urban.  I shared spiced chicken wraps and pommes with my roommate Jackie.  Pommes are wedge type fries.  This was my favorite meal so far.  One of the girls I was with ordered what she thought was a fanta, but she ended up with a big beer.  After lunch we split, half of the girls went home.  I stayed and went shopping for the remainder of the afternoon.  We left about an hour before we planned, but after train trouble we ended up getting home at the same time we were going to originally.  Our second train was 10 minutes late, which caused us to miss our third.

Overall I really enjoyed Luxembourg.  I feel that it has the perfect balance of tourist sites and shopping.  It feels more classy than other places we have been, and I could walk the paths under the bridges everyday and all day long.  It was very relaxing.
