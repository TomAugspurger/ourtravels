I just wanted to say thank you for the packages!  I know it expensive to get them over here so it means a lot.  Tom and I have literally ate the whole bag of puppy chow and cookies my mom sent behalf of herself and the Mahoneyâ€™s!  They were still fresh after being in the mail over a week.

Jane, the Des Moines t-shirt could not have come at a more perfect time.  It makes home feel a little closer.  Thank you.

We are over halfway through, and I miss you all! Hugs***
