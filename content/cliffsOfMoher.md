title: Cliffs of Moher
date: 2014-08-12

As we near the end of our trip, we embarked on our third and final bus tour in Ireland.
This one was with Paddywagon Tours, and we left Dublin for the west coast of Ireland at 8:00.
The highlight of the day was seeing the Cliffs of Moher, but we had a few stops along the way first.

We drove along the Atlantic coast for a while, and then turned off for a bit to see an old Abbey.

After that we took at quick photo stop at the "baby" cliffs, which seemed pretty big to us.
This ones average about 90 feet above sea level, while the real ones are 700 feet high.

Finally, we made it to the Cliffs of Moher.
They really were spectacular, stretching as far as we could see in both directions.

There's parking lot and visitor center are in the middle.
They keep you quite far back from the edge, but on either side are paths that get a bit closer and give a better view (we still stayed well back off the edge; the memorials serve as a warning too).

We didn't quite have time to go all the way to the tip of the peninsula before our bus left.
If you ever have then chance to go to Ireland, the Cliffs are a must-see.
