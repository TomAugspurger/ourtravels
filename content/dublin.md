Today was all about flexibility.
We signed up for a bus tour for the Ring of Kerry, which left from Killarney â€“ about a 2 hour train ride from Dublin.
Unfortunately, After an hour or so, the train in front of ours broke down, blocking our way.
This meant we'd be unable to get to Killarney to catch the bus.

Things worked out pretty well in the end though.
The trains in Ireland have WiFi, so we were able to contact the tour company to let then know we wouldn't make it.
They were very flexible and we've rescheduled for Monday.
The rail company were also apologetic and opened up the cafe for free food and drinks (except alcohol).
We got off at the next station and went back to Dublin.

We made it back in time to get some lunch and catch the walking tour.
It took us around to the biggest sights in the center of the city.
There were a bunch of things right near our hostel that we hadn't seen yet (like a castle), even though there just a block off the main street.

We have an early morning tomorrow (a bus tour up to Northern Ireland), so we decided to call it an early night.
But not before picking up some delicious Taco fries.
