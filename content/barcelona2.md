Title: Barcelona (Day 2)
Date: 2014-07-05

For our second day in Barcelona we had two musts: Sagrada Familia and the Fat Tire Bike tour.

The Sagrada Familia opens at 9:00, and even though we got there at 9:00, it was already busy.
When we got to the front of the ticket line, they were selling tickets for entry at 12:15.
Instead of waiting around the church for a few hours, we just hoped on the metro for Barceloneta, Barcelona's closest beach.
Despite arriving early, the beach was already filling up.

After a couple hours there, it was back on the metro and up to see the Sagrada Familia.

I was surprised that I enjoyed the inside of the church more than the outside.
Gaudi deliberately wanted to invoke an image of a forest, and he succeed.

We'd done Fat Tire tours in all the other cities where they have them (Berlin, Paris, and London), so this was the last ride to check off the list.
Instead of doing the standard ride through the city, we signed up for the Montjuïc ebike tour.
Montjuïc is a mountain just outside Barcelona, which was the cemetery for the city's Jewish population back when they weren't allowed to honor their dead in the city.

Since biking up mountains is hard, and we were here to have fun, Fat Tire had ebikes for everyone to ride.
An ebike is like a cross between a regular bike and a moped.
It had pedals, breaks, gears, and everything else like a regular bike.
The difference is a battery and a motor that accelerates you each time you pedal.

It was a bit surprising at first, but by the time we were going up the mountain we were glad to have the ebikes.

Our tour took us along the site of the 1929 Exposition (kind of like a world's fair), where a Harley-Davidson rally was being held.

After that we rode around to the Olympic Park.

Then it was to the top of the mountain for some great views and some great churros.
