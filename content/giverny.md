title: Giverny

Today was just a quick trip up to Giverny to see Monet's house and garden.
It's just a 40 minute train ride to Vernon, and from there a 10 minute bus ride to the small town of Giverny.

We started off with the gardens, making our way across the property to the ware lilly pond.
It was an interesting contrast to the gardens at the ch√¢teau [yesterday](chateaus.html).
Those were neat and orderly, focused on yielding a lot of flowers for the chateau.
The area around the pond had a lot of flowers, but they were growing wherever they pleased.

The house was modest, but colorful.
Allison remarked that she could see herself decorating our house in a similar style, if not the same color scheme.

Once we got back to Paris, we walked over to the Notre Dame area to find Allison's favorite chocolate shop from when she came here in high school.

Last time we were here, about 5 years ago with Kayla and Eric, it was closed for the summer while the owners were on holiday.
This time we were surprised to see it was open, but they didn't have the big bags of chocolate that Allison remembered getting before.

You should check the whole thing out, Allison took some great pictures in the garden.
