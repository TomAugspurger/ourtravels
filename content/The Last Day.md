This is it, the summer is over. It went by in a flash... at times it dragged on, but as a whole, I cannot believe its over. Friendships were made, and the goodbyes today were painful. The people I worked with this summer are truly special people. The children we worked for were great, and some will have special places in our hearts.

Thanks for the care packages Mom and Dad, and thanks for all the support from everyone else. I hope this blog kept you entertained.
