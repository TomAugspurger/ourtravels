title: Rotterdam and Amsterdam
date: 2014-07-21

Friends, we are officailly tired...  This is impacting nothing but blogging!  So, I will catch you up.  From the 19th to the 22nd we enjoyed the Netherlands.  We found our hotel in Rotterdam, walked around a festival that was going on, and enjoyed some fries with mayonaise...

The next day we got up early and went to the Anne Frank House.  We waited in line for quite awhile (in the rain!), but we met some friendly individuals (including a couple that are participating in Camp Adventure).  Of course this was a heavy experience, but a reminder of human stregnth.  

Following this, we hopped on the train and went to Zaanse Schans.  This reminded me of our Living History Farms.  The museum was a bit disappointing, but the rest of our time there was enjoyable.  We sampled cheese, explored windmills, and walked through the old town.

When we arrived back at our hotel, we were starving.  So, we stopped by the doner shop.  This is where we discovered the *kapsalon*.  This is a dish founded in Rotterdam.  Imagine, a layer of fries, then meat, then sauces, finally a layer of cheese, baked to perfection.  Out of the oven it comes, more sauce, cucumber, lettuce, red onion, and tomato.  Let's just say, we enjoyed this dish multiple times...

The next day we had a picnic at the beach (The Hague).  It was a bit chilly, but a lazy day was needed.  I would love to visit this area again.  The boardwalk looked like it had a lot of fun restauraunts and lots to do.
