Title: Cinque Terre
Date: 2014-06-23

Today we had a blast traveling through Cinque Terra.
This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a set of 5 villages nestled into the west coast of Italy.

On the recommendation of Allison's mom, we bought tickets for the ferry between villages.
There are trains connecting each village, but the ferry provided some great pictures as we came up to the coast.

Most of the towns feature colorful buildings rising steeply up from the shore.

Our routine for each village was more or less

- jump off the ferry
- find food
- wander the streets
- catch the next ferry to the next village

Again on recommendation from Kate, we got lunch at *Ristorante da Ely* in Monterosso.

On of the main attractions of Cinque Terre is the hiking between villages.
Usually you can go between all five, but due to landslides, only one of the sections was open.
This one section was still the highlight of the day.

After the hike was a quick dip in the sea, followed by the train ride home.
There's a bunch more pictures in the [album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/81581328@N02/sets/72157645283442006/).
