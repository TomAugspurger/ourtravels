Title: Barcelona (Day 1)
Date: 2014-07-04

We've arrived in Spain!
Our first four days will be in Barcelona;
following that: Madrid.

Today we wanted to get a feel for the city, so we did the New Europe walking tour.
It mainly focused on the old Gothic quarter, whose history goes back at least to Roman times.

We also learned a lot about the Spanish Civil War and got to see some of the ruins and monuments.

After the tour we went to the large park near the Barcelona Zoo.

We hoped to slip into the Sagrada Familia quickly, but failed to plan ahead.
The line was too long for the night, but we managed to get some pictures.
Tomorrow we'll see the inside.

Gaudi, who designed the Sagrada Familia, also designed several houses around the city, and we got to see two of them: Casa Milà and Casa Batlló.
Unfortunately Casa Milà was covered up with scaffolding, but Casa Batlló was great.

Our final activity for the evening was a tapas tour.
In a group of about 30 people we went to 3 different restaurants and tried various drinks and tapas.

The first restaurant had the best food by far.
We tried a bread doused in oil and other seasonings, a croquette, chorizo, and potatoes covered in garlic aioli.

The second restaurant was one big gimmick around the vessel we drank from (I can't remember the name).
But it was a fun gimmick.

The final restaurant wasn't that great, but we did get some tasty sangria.

We ended the night with some doner kepab.
