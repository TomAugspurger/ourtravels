Today was our first full day in Rome.
It's a pretty cool city.

Our first stop of the day was (of course) the Colosseum.
We don't have much to add to what's already been written about how marvelous the architecture is, and the wonderful and tragic events that took place there.
Well worth the price of admission.

Speaking of price of admission, the ticket to the Colosseum also allows entry to the nearby Roman Forum and Palantino.
Unfortunately, both of these were closed due to a strike.
We'll try to stop by tomorrow and see if they're open.
From the outside, the forum looked similar to what we saw in Trier, Germany, when we were there a few summers ago.

After that was lunch, and a walk to (again no surprises) the Pantheon.

Along the way we stopped at the famous Fountain Trevia, which was unfortunately (for us) under renovation.

We also stopped into the church for St. Ignatius Loyola.

A couple blocks further down was the Parthenon.

Since it looked like rain, we went back to the train station a bit early to rest for the next day: the Vatican.
