Today we took the short train ride from Augsburg to Munich.

Not on that train though, it was just leaving the platform as we got there.

We didn't have whole lot planned for the day since it was Sunday.
In Catholic Bavaria, most places were closed.

We did (another) free walking tour that started in Mariaplatz, a center square of Munich with the new City Hall and the Glockenspiel.

Our tour guide, Amanda, has been doing this for 4 years and was one of the best we've had.
She took us around the city covering the founding of Munich, the various plagues to hit it, its role in the World Wars and the Nazi party, and its post-war history. And of course, the Hofbrauhaus.

After the tour we went to Nymphenburg palace (protip: it's off the Laim S-bahn stop, not the Laimburg stop; we found that out the hard way).
This was the palace of Ludwig I.

It's huge, but the ticket only gives you access to a small part of the castle.
On the walking tour, Amanda told a story about how Ludwig was a big womanizer.
After he spent the night with a woman, he'd have the court artist come in and paint of portrait of her.
Apparently he had thousands of these portraits.
30 or so of them are hung in a room outside the Queen's bedroom.

The palace left out the part about Ludwig being a womanizer, so we aren't sure what the real story is.

The palace also has massive gardens, with houses scattered about like Versailles.

We strolled into a couple of these before heading home.
Since it was Sunday most of the restaurants were closed.
But you can always count on a doner shop being open.
We're getting dangerously close to being sick of it though.
