Happy Independence Day!
Since we missed the 4th, the French version will have to do.

I was nervous about missing train connections, so we took a longer, but more direct route.
The ride form Rennes to Paris took about 8 hours!
We made it to our hotel at about 3:30 and dropped our bags off.

We made our way down to the *Champs de Mars*, the park around the Eiffel Tower, as quickly as possible.
Each year they have a big celebration there in remembrence of their independence.
Knowing that the fireworks didn't start until 11:00, we stocked up on sandwiches, tarts, and other delicious snacks.

The park was filling up quickly, but I spotted a couple leaving.
This meant that we had pretty much perfect seats.

To keep ourselves entertained we played cards, listened to the orchestra/opera singers, and ate a lot.

As 11:00 came closer I got pretty excited.
They orchestra ended with the French National Anthem, which everyone got up to sing.

After that was the fireworks show.
It was the best show we've seen, even beating out the 4th of July at the Washington Monument a few years ago.
They involved the Eiffel Tower in the show, shooting off fireworks from it, big torches, even people dangling from it.
It was a great show.

Afterwards all the metros around the tower were shut down, probably for safety.
We just started walking away, hoping we could get to our last train.
We eventually found an open metro and got to the station.
We ran to the connection to catch the train, even knowing we should have a couple minutes to spare.
As we got to the platform we saw it pulling away; it left early!

The walk back wasn't bad, just a bit long.
It certainly didn't take away from a great evening.
