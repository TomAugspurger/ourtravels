title: Neuschwanstein
date: 2014-07-26

We arrive in Augsburg (yes, Augsburg with a 'b') last night.
We're staying here since it's in between Füssen, where we went today, and Munich, our destination for tomorrow.

You may not have heard of Füssen, but it's the closest town to Neuschwanstein castle.
And if you haven't heard of Neuschwanstein castle, you have probably seen it.
It's the one that inspired the look of Cinderella's Castle.

We'd heard that there isn't really much to see on the inside, so we weren't expecting much when we went in.
But the inside was actually very interesting (no pictures though).
They take you on a guided tour through the finished rooms, which includes the apartments of Ludwig II (who died before it was finished), a chapel, a grotto, and the throne room.
Since it was a relatively recent castle (late 1800s) it was very different from the ones we saw in [Potsdam](potsdam.html) the other day.

The next site everyone goes to is Mary's bridge, which offers a good, but not the best, view of the castle.

I say it's not the best view because on the other side of the bride from where all the tourists are dropped off by the buses is a nice set of hiking trails.
We didn't have a map, but set off anyway to see what we'd see.

After about 10 minutes we came across an opening offering a better (but still not best!) view of the castle.

After another 10 to 15 minutes of hiking, the trail opened up to show our best view of the day.

Both the Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau castles are visible, one in front of the other.
We turned back at this point because we didn't want to stray too far.
A lucky choice too, since as we got back to the castle it started raining so we ducked into a cafe and ate some spaghetti and goulash soup (a perfect dish for the rainy day).

As we finished up lunch the rain finished up too.
We walked the 25 minutes back down to the town and went to the other castle you could see earlier, Hohenschwangau.
This was the old castle in the area, and we didn't actually go in it; just around the outside.

Again there were some nice hiking trails around the castle, and we found what we think was an old tombstone or monument.

We kept hiking and came across a super-clear glacier lake.

After that it was time to head back.
As we walked back the rain started again.
Our lucky streak continued and we just caught the bus back to Füssen as it started to pour.

After we got home to Augsburg we sat down for a nice dinner at a Thai place we'd seen the night before.
The perfect end to the perfect day.
