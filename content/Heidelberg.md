After a long day of traveling, and an all too short night of rest, Allison and I made our way to the town of Heidelberg early the next morning. We were with a smaller group for this trip, only 5 people instead of the 13 for the Trier trip.

Heidelberg offered a new challenge of public transportation: the local bus system. Trier almost seemed to have almost been built with the tourist in mind. Most of the attractions were all on a loop, within a short walk from the train station. Heidelberg, on the other hand, is a sprawling town. The town is basically split into three parts running west to east along the river to the north: The New District, The Old District, and The Castle. The main feature of Heidelberg, the Heidelberg Castle, is reached easiest by bus. With some help from the tourist info center we were able to find the correct bus line.

The castle was built in the early 13th century, and overlooks the town from the hills east of the main city. The climb up to the castle shows how it could be an easily defended fortress in a time of war. The pictures I took of the incline don't really do it justice. We purchased the audio tour and were given handsets and a map, so we could learn some history about the place. The castle was first used by Ludwig I. It has since fallen into ruins, and in the late 1800's it was decided that attempts to rebuild the castle should end, and instead preservation should be the primary objective. We toured the inner castle and learned about the additions made during the Renaissance. Next we strolled outside to see the collapsed tower. The castle was struck by lightning, and the 8 meter thick wall was split. The halves of the tower settled into a picturesque resting place. There was a marvelous lookout point further down the courtyard, which was favored by artists and poets during the castle's heyday.

The castle was a huge adventure and took up most of our day. We were able to walk around the Old District just west of the castle and see the Old University as well as a breathtakingly beautiful church. After that, we made our way back to the train station where we grabbed a late lunch/early dinner. We caught the 4:00 train back to Ramstein for our meeting at 8:00. We are here for camp after all.
