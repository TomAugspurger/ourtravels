title: Paris (Day 2)
date: 2014-07-15

Today we we planned on seeing the Catacombs, but we came too late and the line was already too long.

Instead we went over towards St. Michele and Notre Dame.
Since we've been to Paris before (multiple times) we'd already done the biggest attactions.
So instead of waiting in line to see Notre Dame again, we went into St. Chapelle.
This was on the recommendation of our Fat Tire Bike Tour guide from our last time there.

We joined another free walking tour.
Our tour guide, a native Parisian, was worried that our group of 30 people was too large to work well, so he called another guide to help out.
However the other guide couldn't get there until 30 minutes later, so we started with the full group.

The first stop was Moulin Rouge.
We heard stories about how people used to go just outside the city walls do conduct their disreputable business, before returning home.
This echoed similar stories that we heard on our Madrid walking tour.
Some things are human nature.

We then gradually walked up the hill, towards Sacré-Cœur, the church at the top.
We learned about French independence movements and French culinary.

When the other guide showed up, we split off with her to finish off the tour.
