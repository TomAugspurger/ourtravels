Title: Venice
Date: 2014-06-27

We arrived to our luxurious bungalow Thursday afternoon.

The next morning we set off early for Venice.
We arrived early enough to beat most of the crowd.
Having the city to ourselves was refreshing, all the more so anticipating the crowds that were coming.

Today we were in the hands of Rick Steves, whose audio tour podcasts we downloaded.
The first stop was the Square of St. Mark (of the Gosepl of Mark fame).

As we made our way along the lagoon to the east of St. Mark's Square,
we noticed that the Doge's (Duke's) Palace had just opened, and there was no line.
We walked right in and learned a bit of Venetian history and saw some spectacular room.
They didn't allow photos for most of it, so you'll need to come see it for yourself.

After the Palace, we got in line to see St. Mark's Cathedral.
We'd already heard about how the Venetians basically stole a bunch of stuff to decorate the structure.
The inside was even more ornate than the outside, but again, no pictures.

Afterwards we spent a couple hours just wandering and enjoying the city itself.
We got lunch and made our way back to where we started our day to hop on a vaperrato (waterbus).

Rick Steves had another podcast designed to be listened to while traveling from Piazzle Roma to St. Mark's Square by vaperrato.
This gave some great views from the Grand Canal.

Venice was a lovely place.
