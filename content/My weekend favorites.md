First Favorite-

Belgium waffles-  The waffles were amazing, and for me to say that it takes a lot.  I thought my waffles were good until I took a bite out of a Belgium waffle with strawberries and whipped creme.  They were so much lighter than the ones we have in the US.

Second Favorite-

Belgium chocolate-  So, my goal this weekend was to bring home lots of chocolate.  The problem with this was that it was so fresh.  Now this seems like a strange problem, but because it was fresh it melted very fast.  We had to eat all the chocolate bought!  My favorite was a raspberry creme.   Even though we were not able to bring any home, it was amazing.

Third Favorite-

Mass in Cologne-  The one thing I wanted to accomplish on Sunday was to go to mass at the Cathedral in Cologne.  We left Brussels at 7:30 am and we were supposed to arrive at 9:20 am.  Well the train trouble caused us to go from waiting, to catching a bus, to finding another train.  We finally arrived at 11:50.  I thought that we had to have missed mass.  To my surprise we walked out of the station and the cathedral was literally 200 ft away.  It might as well be a part of the station.  As Tom was taking pictures the bell began to ring and I insisted we go to see if they are having mass.  Sure enough mass began at noon and it was only 11:55.  We made it, and I will always remember that day.  Not only were my eyes moving throughout the building, but my ears were listening to a familiar practice in a different language.  The organ was so loud that you could barely hear people singing, and the incense smelled amazing.  There were many recognizable parts, but at this time I would have paid any amount of money to understand German.  Especially during the homily.  The only words I recognized were Michael Jackson.  He repeated this many times, and I wish I knew how the priest tied him into it.

Fourth Favorite

Making it a more relaxed weekend-  We went with no real plan, and played everything by ear.  I enjoyed this.  Things were a lot less stressful.  Our hotel was also a pleasant surprise.  It was very clean, and we had our own bathroom.  It was also about the price of a hostel.  Even with the trouble on the train this weekend was stress free.



Final Favorite

Three course dinner-  This dinner began with a drink of our choice.  I had red wine, but I guess I am not a fan because I did not like it (or it was not a good kind).  I began with a first course of fried cheese, and Tom had smoked salmon.  They were both very good.  Then I had a steak with a mushroom gravy and fries.  Tom had lamb and fries.  The fries were quite delicious.  We ended the dinner with desert.  Cake with a creme topping.

The only thing I did not like about the dining experience in Brussels is that the workers stood outside and hassled you to choose their restaurant.  I did not like this pressure and had never experienced it before.  I would rather walk around and look at all the menus without being bothered!

There were many other things I loved, but these were just a few highlights!!
