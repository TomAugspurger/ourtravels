Yesterday was pretty much just a travel day.
Santorini is far enough south that getting back
to Athens took 7 hours by ferry.
Allison was a bit concerned that many of the ferry
workers were watching the Greece v. Columbia World Cup match
instead of doing their job.

We joined a free walking tour that hit the high points of Athens,
mainly centered around the Acropolis.

For lunch, we picked up some great street food.

From there, we strolled down to the Temple of Zeus, the largest
temple in Athens, and built by the Roman emperor Hadrain.

The timing worked out so that we could see the changing of the guard
outside the palace.
Since it was Sunday, the guards were decked out in their fanciest garb.

After the tour was over, we wanted to actually go *up to* the Acropolis.
This meant walking up the hill to the Acropolis again,
but the sights up there were well worth the walk.

We saw the famous Parthenon, as well as a few other less well-known buildings
at the top of the Acropolis.
It must have been an incredible sight in its day.

Following the Acropolis was a stroll through the Placka market (on recommendation from Chris and Lauren) to the National Archaeological Museum.

The museum was great.
Two years ago we visited the British Museum, where much of the ruins from the Parthenon and other Greek artifacts are kept.
Apparently, there's some tension between the Greeks and British about the proper spot for these items.

On our walk back to the hostel from the Acropolis, we started hearing rumbles of thunder.
Next we saw lightning so we decided to duck into the train station for a bit.
Good thing too, since it down-poured for 10 minutes.
After the rain stopped, Allison bought some of the best strawberries we've had from a street vendor.

Finally it was back to the hostel to plan our next few days out.
The Greek rail and bus situation is terrible (at least for tourists).
Most Google results are the third-party sites trying to explain how things work.
If everything goes according to plan, tomorrow we catch a bus to Delphi!
