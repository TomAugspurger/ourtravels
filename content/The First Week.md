title: The First Week

The first week is already gone! It's been quite a week. We've had orientation for camp, settled into our new living arrangements, meet our new roommates, and even managed to travel the past couple days (I'll put those blog posts up later).

As far as my camp duties go, I'm at Ramstein Youth Programs. I will have children anywhere from 9-14 years old. The Youth Program offers a variety of camps to the kids. Arts and Crafts camp, Computer camp, Travel camp, and Extreme camp are just a few. It sounds like we'll mostly be supplementing the staff already present in the youth center. This isn't normally what Camp Adventure does. Usually we come in and more or less build a site specific program ourselves from the ground up. I guess the Air Force operates a little differently because, for the Youth Programs at least, the programming is all already provided. We'll still be able to add our own Camp Adventure flare.
