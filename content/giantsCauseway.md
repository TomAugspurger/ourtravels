We did something a bit different today: our first guided bus tour.
The tour took us up north to Belfast and Giant's Causeway.

After the couple hour trek up to Belfast we were given the choice between the Titanic Experience and the Black Taxi Tour.
Allison, being a fan of the *Titanic* since she was younger, chose the Titanic Experience.

Tom opted for the Black Taxi Tour, which is a cab ride around Belfast.
The Black Taxis were the main mode of transportation around the city during the "troubles", the conflict between the Catholic Republicans and the Protestant Loyalists, since the public transit system was too dangerous.

Belfast is filled with memorials commemorating all sorts of people and events.

From hunger strikers, to those killed in the fighting, to those doing the killing, to sympathies for Palestine today.
We stopped often and got out of the cab to hear our cabbie tell us more of the history behind the memorials.

At noon we grouped back up at the bus and went on the the Giant's Causeway.
This is a huge UNESCO world heritage site that sits on the Atlantic Ocean.

We got to hike down to the shoreline and along a couple of trails.
At the end of one trail was some reddish rock that reminded us of the Red Beach in Santorini (almost 2 months ago!).

The weather was certainly different though, lots of wind and rain today.

We had one more stop on the trip: the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge.

This was a 50 to 60 foot rope bridge connecting the mainland to a small island that gave some great views of the coast and of the Atlantic.
The bridge crossing itself was fun, but a bit disconcerting if you're scared of heights.

Overall it was a fun, packed day.
