Title: Broc and Gruyere
Date: 2014-06-30

Today we took a trip to the Calliers chocolate factory in Broc.
I'm nominating it for the chocolate factory with the best views outside its windows.

When we arrived, we worried that we may be a bit older than the target audience.
We probably were, but we enjoyed the tour anyway.
It was a series of rooms, each fully automated, giving a history of chocolate and the company.

After the tour, we got to see (and touch and smell) some of their ingredients.

And what would a factory tour be without a tasting?
They faked us out a bit by having a small bowl of chocolate at the end of this machine.

Following that was another set of doors that we worried was the exit.
Instead, it led to the real tasting room.

There were about 30 - 40 varities to try.
Tom planned to sample each but gave up about 3/4 of the way through.
A pity, too, since they put the best chocolate at the end.

Gruyere
=======

After eating all that chocolate, we needed to walk around for a bit.
We took the short train ride to Gruyere, a town famous for their cheese.
We were too late to visit the cheese factory, but there was a castle to see.

The castle itself wasn't the most interesting, but the views were great.
