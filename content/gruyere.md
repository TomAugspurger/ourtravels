Title: Broc and Gruyeres
Date: 2014-06-30

Today we took a trip to the Calliers chocolate factory in Broc.
I'm guessing it's the chocolate factory with the best views outside its windows.

When we arrived, we worried that we may be a bit older than the target audience.
We probably were, but we enjoyed the tour anyway.
It was a series of rooms, each fully automated, giving a history of chocolate and the company.

After the tour, we got to see (and touch and smell) some of their ingredients.

And what would a factory tour be without a tasting?
They had as much chocolate as we cared to eat at the end of the tour.

Gruyeres

After eating all that chocolate, we needed to walk around for a bit.
We took the short train ride to Gruyeres, a town famous for their cheese.
We were too late to visit the cheese factory, but there was a castle to see.
