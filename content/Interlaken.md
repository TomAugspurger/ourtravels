What an amazing weekend. We spent the weekend down in Interlaken, Switzerland with 16 other Camp A counselors. Stan, the director for the teen center on base, helped us out with the weekend. He drove half of us down Friday night while the rest took the train. Because he spent four years working for Outdoor Recreation, he was a great asset to have along with us on the trip.

After about a six hour drive, we got into our lodging for the night. We stayed at Balmer's tent village. They were soft sided tents, with wooden planks for floors, 3 bunk beds, and a propane heater.

Allison, Kayla, myself, and a few others got up early the next morning with Stan, and he drove us up to Trimelbach. Back in the 1950's, holes and tunnels were blown into the mountain to give views to 10 different waterfalls. Each of the falls had its own personal characteristics. The sound of the water rushing down and echoing off the walls of the cave was heart stopping. The water was flowing really hard and fast that day because there had been heavy rain the day before. We could feel the pressure changing as we walked down the stairs from water thundering past.

After Trimelbach, we had a quick lunch and went back to the Outdoor Interlaken office. They're the company that runs all the extreme sports in the Interlaken area. We were planning on going white water rafting at 4, but it was canceled because the water was too high. Stan had gone there dozens of times and he had never heard of rafting getting canceled.

Instead of rafting Allison and I walked to downtown Interlaken. It is an amazing city. There are two huge lakes on either side, with two rivers flowing through the city. The water is a beautiful turquoise. We took a short hike, went back to the village for dinner, and settled in for the night to prepare for our big day of canyoning the next day.
