title: Berlin (Day 1)
date: 2014-07-23

We arrived in Berlin last night, found our hotel, and rested up for a full day today.
This morning we took the 2 hour ICE train up to Hamburg.

Hamburg seemed like a pleasant town.
There was a bunch of shopping and places to eat near the Hauptbahnhof.
We got a box of Asian noodles and meet with our guide for the walking tour.

Our guide was interesting and seemed very knowledgeable.
He told us about some of the history of Hamburg, including the founding and its part in WWII.

We had to leave the tour about halfway through to catch the train back to Berlin in time for our second activity for the day: another Fat Tire Bike Tour.

This was our 4th Fat Tire tour of the trip, and like the others it was great.
We had already done the regular city tour in Berlin 5 years ago when we were here, so we signed up for the food tour.

After biking for about 10 minutes, we stopped in a little park for some champagne and conversation.

Our first stop for food was *Falafel Da Falafel*, which as you can guess was not authentic German cuisine (we were totally OK with that).
They brought out pita bread, falafel, and a fried cheese dish.
The falafel was probably the best we've ever had.

After that we went towards East Berlin and saw some sections of the Berlin Wall.

The second food stop was where we got some real German food.

We did some more biking and ended with some coffee and cake, which also isn't technically a German dish, but it was delicious.
Allison got a chocolate ganache cake and Tom got a raspberry dish.
