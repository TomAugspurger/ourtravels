Title: Basel
Date: 2014-06-29

For our last day in Switzerland we stuck around Basel, knowing that we had a lot of planning to do for the next leg of our trip (Spain).
We started off with a nice walk through a nature area to the north of Basel.
We think that at some point we crossed into Germany, but we aren't entirely sure.

We stumbled across a small, free zoo.

Finally, we checked out the sights in Basel itself.
