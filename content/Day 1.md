Today began with my roommate and I thinking my roommates were crazy because there were up at 6:37am.  It  turns out that our alarm clock is slow, and it was 8:22am and our first meeting started in 8 minutes!  Luckily we were able to take the clock from the living room, so we should be fine tomorrow.

After the meeting we were able to do whatever we wanted.  We were informed that we won't be able to use commissary.  So, we took a cab into Ramstein MessinBach.  It is a beautiful place, and the groceries were not that expensive.  We bought at least a weeks worth of food for the two of us, and it was only about 30 euro.  It was fun trying to figure out what certain things were.  When checking out we did not think about grocery bags, and there you buy them.  So Kayla had bought all of her food before we figured this out.  Luckily the cashier showed me where they were and we hurried to pack everything.  We bought 6 huge water bottles, and when we got back Tom opened one and it flew all over.  We accidently bought carbonated!

I'm very happy that we are doing our shopping off base.  It is very easy, interesting, and entertaining.  I could spend hours there.

There are a lot of little shops in the Ramstein Village.  I already bought some clothes!!
