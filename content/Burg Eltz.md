After an exciting day, and an expensive night, in Amsterdam I was ready to see a castle.  We got up at 5:45 am to eat a very nice breakfast.  They had lots of bread, croissants, and fresh fruit.  They also had eggs, sausage, and backed beans.

Our train left at seven and we arrived in Moselkern at one in the afternoon.  This was quite the train station.  There were only four platforms, and no workers.  We just got off and walked through an empty building.  I was worried because there would have been no way for us to tell if our train was on time, but it worked out!

We found a sign that pointed us in the direction of Burg Eltz, and it said that we had a 90 minute walk ahead of us.  It was a beautiful walk.  The homes were like none we have seen in Germany.  The mountains were very pretty as well.  We lucked out because it was not hot out and it did not rain.  It only took us an hour to get to Eltz, and I was so excited.

Because we were on a time crunch we were unable to wait for the next English tour.  The next tour was in Dutch, and we decided that we just had to see the inside of this place! So we have no idea what was said about Burg Eltz, but it was a great experience.

After the tour we had about 5 minutes to get pictures of the outside, and then we headed back to the train station.  Luckily our train came!  The ride back was the best yet, because it was along the Rhine River.  There were amazing vineyards throughout the mountains, and a few castles.

The scenery from this weekend has made it one of my favorites.
