The past two weeks I have been floating from room to room in the Child Development Center.  I have worked in an infant room, a 1-2 year old room, and a 2-3 year old room.  The infant room was by far my favorite, because time flew by.  At one point I was rocking/feeding one baby in my arms, while rocking two others with my feet.  Although it was my favorite, I was thrown up on a couple times.  My other favorite room is the 1-2 year olds.  All of the kids are pretty wild.  They keep me on my toes.  In those rooms you have to change lots of diapers.  I am getting a lot faster at that.  This week I am working with the 2-3 year olds.  They are in the hitting, kicking, and biting stage.  This can be frustrating at times, but it has all been good practice for my future working with/having kids.

At night we come home, make dinner, hang out and go to bed.  Tonight we walked off base to Ramstein village.  We went grocery shopping.  One day down, and four to go until our next adventure.
