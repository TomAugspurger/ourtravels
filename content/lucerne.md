Title: Lucerne
Date: 2014-07-01

Yesterday was mostly taken up with travel from Venice to Basel, Switzerland.
On the walk from the train station we were caught in a thunderstorm (that happened in Rome too).
Fortunately we found the hostel without issue.

Today we made our way south to Lucerne, the city that sits on Lake Lucerne.

Strangely, we found a trailer for Oklahoma Joe's, which is the best BBQ I've ever had.

We got the next train to Interlaken, which is where we went canyoning when we were here with Camp Adventure.
Nothing like that this time though.
We just passed through on our way to the Golden Pass route, a scenic train through the alps.
