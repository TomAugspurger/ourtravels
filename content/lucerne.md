title: Lucerne
date: 2014-06-29

Yesterday was mostly taken up with travel from Venice to Basel, Switzerland.
On the walk from the train station we were caught in a thunderstorm (that happened in Rome too).
Fortunately we found the hostel without issue.

Today we made our way south to Lucerne, the city that sits on Lake Lucerne.

Strangely, we found a trailer for Oklahoma Joe's, which is the best BBQ I've ever had.

We got the next train to Interlaken, which is where we went canyoning when we were here with Camp Adventure.
No extreme sports this time though.
Just a nice train ride on the Golden Pass route, a scenic train through the alps.

As you can see, it was a cloudy day.
Still some great sights though.
