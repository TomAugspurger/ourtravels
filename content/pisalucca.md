Title: Pisa and Lucca
Date: 2014-06-25

After [Florence yesterday](florence.md), we made our way west to Pisa.
Of course we had to check out the famous leaning tower.

We'd heard that outside the tower there wasn't much to see in Pisa, and I think this is right.
The walk to the tower and surround Cathedral and Baptistery was nice.

We stopped for a quick bite to eat

and were on to our second destination for the day.

Lucca
=====

Lucca is a walled city about 20 minutes from Pisa by train.
They built the city walls, but were never attacked so they're in great shape.

We didn't really have a plan going in.
After strolling around for a bit, we found another cathedral (which doesn't seem that difficult to do in Europe).

We decided to walk the 4 km around the city walls, but before that we found a great (cheap) gelato shop.
5 flavors for â‚¬3.00.

The walk was great, but we'd worked up an appetite for more gelato.
4 more flavors.
